Music-Kal
The Music-Kal website is intended to teach people (with basic knowledge in music and notes) the basics of the music theory (solfege). 

There are two efficient and quite simple learning games: 
The first game is notes recognition – you need to recognize the given notes by hearing the played note and press the correct key on the piano. 
The second game is Intervals recognition – you need to recognize the given intervals by hearing the played interval and press the correct interval button. The game is divided to 6 levels and each level contains two or more different intervals that joins the intervals from the previous levels. 
The full instructions will be found in the beginning of the game.

Project Structure: 
The website is divided into 4 pages – Home page, Interval trainings, Notes trainings and about us page as described above.
The project contain only one HTML file and different CSS and JAVASCRIPT files for every page that implements the logic behavior. In addition, there is a JAVASCRIPT file for the piano logic and one for the trainings (all the common functions of the intervals training and notes recognition training).
The CSS files are placed in the CSS folder and the JAVASCRIPT files are placed in the js folder. The images are placed in the image folder that is located inside the CSS folder.
Running Order: 
Click on the main.html file. At the navigator bar you will find the games and the other pages.
From there just follow the instructions.
Important Notes:
*There is some style elements like the header, navigator and footer that are common
   for all the pages, so we decided to placed them in the main.css file.
* We used some special libraries as JAVASCRIPT files. The first one is ‘VEXFLOW’ that
    gives us the possibility to write and play notes. The second is ‘Sweet Alert’ that
    styles the pop-ups windows in the games.
* In the Interval game there is a button ‘CLEAR USERS’ that clears all the local storage if
   you want so, and erases the already registered users.
* The ‘RESTART’ button in the games clear only the current level of the user.
